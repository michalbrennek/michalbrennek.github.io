### From Science to Spaghetti (and Back Again)

You know how it goes. One minute you’re churning out articulated dragons and Terraforming Mars sets for the kids (and by "kids," I mean all the kids at home, myself included), and the next, you’re back to Serious Business™.

For me, "Serious Business" usually means printing bits of scientific equipment. I’m talking custom holders for measurement devices mounted on drones, specialized brackets, the works. It’s a world of single-filament utilitarianism. It’s a world of tweaking wall thickness by a fraction of a millimeter and whispering sweet nothings to the adaptive honeycomb infill settings.

Oh, the joy of structural integrity.

It’s precise. It’s functional. It’s… frankly, a little dry.

So, naturally, I decided to treat myself. My trusty ThinkPad P16 has been sweating like a marathon runner lately while crunching massive oceanography reanalyses. The poor thing needed a lift—literally. I found a sleek, custom stand.

But this wasn’t just any stand. This was going to be a masterpiece. Two colors.

Black (because obviously).

Red (for that classic ThinkPad aesthetic).

I hit print, expecting the same perfection I get from my scientific mounts.

The Horror Show Begins
What I got instead was a crime against manufacturing. Uneven layers, fibers, and suboptimal color transitions.

I did the usual checks: 200% climate control at home, actively drying filaments, strictly no farting within a 200m range, standing on one leg for the duration of 16h print, especially during high tide - you know, the standard protocol.

But it didn't matter. There were wispy little fibers dragging across the color changes. Pieces of "poop" (technical term) were being dragged back onto the print bed like unwanted guests at a party.

I panicked. My printer is dying, I thought. The precision is gone. And of course, this happens right after two years of ownership, just as the warranty expired.

I went into full engineer mode. I scrambled. I bought €400 worth of spare parts. I examined the printing assembly and rebuilt three-quarters of it. I fine-tuned belts, greased rods, and probably recalibrated the phase of the moon.

The Result?

Meh.

The third test print was "okay," but still not the pristine quality I used to get (especially compared to my single-filament prints). I was defeated. I stared at my machine, wondering if its spirit had finally broken after two years of hardcore abuse.

And then, I clicked one button.

"Enable Prime Tower"

That was it. That was the fix. The fibers at color transitions disappeared. The poop stayed in the chute. It turns out, I didn't need a total overhaul; I just needed a sacrificial tower of plastic to clean the nozzle between colors.

So, here I sit with a perfectly printed black-and-red ThinkPad stand, a printer that is now technically "better than new," and a box of slightly used spare parts—oh well.

Was the €400 overhaul a waste? Let's call it... preventative maintenance for a machine that's survived two years of my P1-pushing. But let this be a lesson to you all: sometimes the solution isn't a new extruder assembly. Sometimes, it’s just a little checkbox you forgot about.

Happy printing (and purge the hell out of it)!
