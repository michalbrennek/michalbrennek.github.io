### The Mission: To Terraform Mars - on the Kitchen Table (for now)
The plan was simple: load up the model, hit print, and come back in a few hours to some shiny new tiles for the kids (in us too). Of course, simple plans rarely survive contact with reality. There was just one problem: the spool of dark grey PLA was looking suspiciously light. The thought of a potential AMS jam meant one thing: I wasn't going anywhere. I was on printer babysitting duty.

Staring at a printer for an hour is a special kind of meditative boredom. It's also the perfect incubator for those 'you know what I should finally do?' ideas. For me, it was time to brush up on my GitHub skills and finally have a look at this Ruby thing... Maybe learn the basics of Jekyll and get a blog running on GitHub Pages. 

### There is always the side quest

It’s not like I needed another blog. I already have one for teaching navigation and high-latitude sailing. Another that's somewhat personal PM'y stuff. And now... this one. So the question is, what shall I do with it? Maybe - eventually - during 'mythical free time', so around two thousand thirty never - I'll write an aggregator. A tool to collect all my `stdout` from everywhere and pipe it to a single domain. One blog to rule them all. Then again, with blogs, it's like... ~~hoarding~~ no, wait. It was *herding* cats.Wasn't it?  

Well as it is with quick "great ideas" before the printer finished its job I fired up my Windows 11 machine, installed Ruby, Jekyll, and Git, and promptly drove the whole project off a cliff.

The next hour was a focused deep dive into the digital engine room. No frantic multitasking, just a methodical attack on a chain of frustrating errors. It was a quick tour of wrestling with system variables in Windows, untangling the mess of failed Actions on GitHub, deleting the custom workflows that were causing all the havoc, and finally, the satisfying brutality of a single `git push --force`. And then, silence. It worked.

### The Final Boss: The Capital

So here I am. The kids have their nice new tiles—or they will, once this last piece is done. I'm writing this while waiting for the "capital" to print. It's the only tile that needs that last bit of dark grey, and the printer is back on the final, dwindling centimeters of filament. The risk of a jam is back, a tiny bit of suspense to cap off the project. And it's official I'm ~~herding~~ hoarding blogs. I've got one for teaching navigation, one that's somewhat personal, and now this. I guess I'll just keep trying new things and writing about the chaotic journey it takes to get them done. Welcome to the workshop. Oh, wait. It's "the lab" these days. Welcome to the LAB.
